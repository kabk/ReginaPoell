		aBSTRACT 
		<br>	If we strive for perfection one must realize that perfection is firstly judged by the standpoint of the viewer, thus might be very different from one another, but 'by definition takes us beyond assumptions and what we think we know'1. The quest for perfection therefore is quiet impossible or a never successful story. If we come up with a concept and ideas, in order to succeed with the project, we automatically build up an image in our minds which we strive for.
		 Nevertheless there is a huge 'gap between the intention and realization of an artwork which makes failure impossible to avoid'2. Although many people fear imperfection it is exactly that little something which opens a new range for artists. As 'to be an artist is to fail like no other dare to fail'3. This leads to a certain point where an artist is actually allowed to fail. There is a point in each project where one has to let go in the sense of giving up control, releasing it to the public. In this case the artist then enters an area of not-knowing which can easily become an act of bravery. Who hasn't experiences the feeling of embarrassment, when you just want to shrink to a little nothing or disappear in the ground when judged by others. That act of bravery standing strong and keeping your head up means to step aside from the orthodox order. To succeed in failing or to fail at failing. And then again often it's worth considering that the deepest failures are in fact no failures at all'4.

<div id="motivation">
	1 - mOTIVATION<br>
	Perfection is something everybody strives for. We all fear imperfection in our lives. Whether with our families, in our romances or our jobs.
The inspiration came from myself and life journey up to now. To be more specific I was told to repeat the my final year at the art academy in order to make an even better designer as there was still so much for me to learn. I decided to take some time out and first travel for a bit. So looking at my CV it surely is not perfect with a gap in the academic career but this little imperfection which firstly seemed so negative turned into something positive and I think really enhanced my personality and also as a designer.
Imperfection might sound negative at first but sometimes it just takes a second look, a different angle or another piece of the puzzle to realize the impact and the added value of imperfection. After all the word does carry the term perfection in itself.
<br><br>
</div>


<div id="intro">
	2 - iNTRODUCTION<br>
		Dealing with imperfection means dealing with a situation or a state of being. It can be found in many different areas such as math, science, art and even politics. The term imperfection can have a positive as well as negative meaning. It is the opposite of perfection. Everybody strives for perfection in one way or the other. Smartphones with no scratches. Batteries with an endless life duration. In a society pushed to perfection, the imperfection will stand out easily. It doesn't necessarily have to have a negative touch but can also be something positive. Just like how the Berlin Wall fell. The imperfection carried out turning into perfection and improvement. And other things even get famous for its imperfection just like the leaning tower of Pisa.
<br>
	Where I want to focus on is the imperfection in design, the process and its constant imperfect state but also how it can add something valuable.
<br>
	What value does imperfection add during the design process? Imperfection and it's natural habit. Why imperfection a natural value is? And after all: How does imperfection add valuable characteristics to Graphic Design? > Mission impossible - Perfection.

3.1 - dEFINITION<br><br>

	Noun: Imperfection<br>
	Opposite: Perfection<br>
	Origin: late latin. imperfectus/imperfectio<br>
	Synonyms: defect, fault, flaw, deformity, disfigurement, crack, scratch, blemish<br><br>

The word imperfection describes<br>
	I. the condition, absence or quality of being imperfect as well as<br>
	II. a fault or defect.1<br>
Imperfection can be described as something which is not complete, has some defects or faults. It makes something differ from the norm and therefore stands out. Sometimes even goes as far as making something unique (leaning tower of Pisa). Imperfection is one part of esthetics.
<br><br>

Imperfection in design can be differentiated into three categories:<br>
I. Material - Is the surface shiny, glossy? Has the mirror a crack? The wood a scratch?<br>
II. Esthetic - Does it follow the golden ratio or any other grid. <br>
III. Functional - Is it usable? Can you see it? Can you read the typography?<br><br>


Earth carries art.<br>
Design carries a sign.<br>
Imperfection carries perfection.

<div id="definition">
	3.2 - tHE aRT oF jUDGING<br>
		In order to know whether a piece of art is perfect or imperfect we have to start at the very basis, the human mind. Looking at art always evokes a certain feeling. This feeling, also referred to as a sentiment, can never be wrong. It is something which is connected to ourselves, to our experiences and our interests and therefore very different from one person to another. “A sentiment does not mark a certain conformity or relation between the object and the organs or the faculties of the mind (...). Beauty is not a quality in things themselves: it exists merely in the mind that contemplates them, an each mind perceives a different beauty.”1<br>
	Growing up people are influenced by different kinds of things therefore it is very likely that a work of art is very beautiful to one person and very ugly to another. When tattoos are a sign of higher status in some cultures it is strongly disapproved and even seen as indicator for lower class affiliation in others. Judging art, whether it is beautiful or ugly, perfect or imperfect, is strongly influenced by culture and maybe even more importantly by language. People grow up in different circumstances and therefore learn how to apply language and its means differently, whether positive or negative. However, the sheer variety of words used to express feelings, means the same word can never be used for one term all around the word. People generally agree that various words describe the feeling of a term whereby people can comprehend what they mean based on their own experience and feelings. A lot of actual meaning is lost in translation.
	Imperfection has not a set definition in the sense of esthetics and is strongly influenced and subject to social change thus is not a timeless description.

	From human evolution we learn that one of the first things the human being ever learned in order to survive was seeing the danger. Whether irregular movement, color, shape or texture our human eye is trained to notice things which don't fit into the normal scenery thus appear to be strange or imperfect in the context. Therefore one could say that it is of human nature that our minds are attracted by imperfection.
Connected to design one can notice that we subconsciously quickly group similar elements and look for differences. Also here the imperfect will stand out easily.<br><br>

	There is many rules which can be applied to Graphic Design. In the 1950 the Swiss Style or also known as The International Typographic Style spread over the whole globe when the magazine New Graphic Design started publishing. Soon it was seen as 'the' style to be used in everything connected to Graphic Design. One could say it was seen as the perfection in Design.
The international Style is based on a mathematical grid. Its characteristics feature strong typographic elements organized in asymmetrical order. The means are to communicate information clearly, free from any propaganda or advertising means. Its emphasis lies on the cleanliness and the ability for the user to read the information presented. It is strongly driven my typographic elements. Mostly used sans-serif typography aligned to the left and/or right. Instead of illustrations more and more often photography was used.<br>
The early pioneers of the movement believed that the design was a “socially useful and important activity (...) the designers defined their role not as artists but as objective conducted for spreading important  information between components of society.”1
When graphic-design used to be a craftsmanship there was many things happening on the table. From drawing grids to typesetting. Things were done by hand. Naturally there was imperfection happening as we are no machines. It happened during the process of drawing or printing. Sometimes could even get frustrating when trying to fix little imperfections. Nevertheless people could not predict it nor avoid it. With the invention of the computer everything quickly changed and by the mid 90s graphic-design had fully shifted into a digital act. From now on things would be happening on the screen. Especially through Apple and its Macintosh and all created software of Adobe. People enjoyed the ability of quick shifting typeface weight or image placing. Also new things were much easier such as overlapping elements. People thought the design was much more under control to be perfect. One good example is the American designer David Carson who used the new techniques and experimental approach and included it into his design. He was much criticized for breaking the rules but also seen as one of the top influential designers of that time by others. The image material he produced included distorted images, cropped and torn typefaces. He put “(...)endlessly contorting type, layout and grid into new configurations and abandoning design's established truths of order and legibility. He represented a new breed of visual author.”2 It was everything but the Swiss Style. Graphic design had emerged into something else driven by technology.<br>
“The digital revolution in graphic design was followed quickly by public access to the Internet. A whole new area of graphic-design activity mushroomed in the mid 1990s when Internet commerce became a growing sector of the global economy, causing organizations and businesses to scramble to establish Web sites. Designing a Web site involves the layout of screens of information rather than of pages, but approaches to the use of type, images, and color are similar to those used for print.”3 So with the internet also for designers evolved new responsibilities. At first it was more companies who wanted to be present in the internet by having their website to show people who they are. Only short after every individual wanted to be represent somewhere in the internet. But not only did they want to show who they are, with development of technology and smartphones they also wanted to be reachable everywhere. From email to Myspace, Facebook, Link-in and WhatsApp (even my autocorrect knows it is not spelled Whatsapp but WhatsApp) the amount of platforms for people to present themselves or be in contact with people increased quickly. Social networks nowadays play an important role in everybody's live and they too need to be designed.<br>
In design currently we can also recognize certain style direction which one is strongly connected to a vintage style and the other one strongly connected to new media. Whereby the one with much use of vintage effects and elements could be seen as only a fashion which also might disappear quickly again.<br>
Nevertheless “in the 21st century, graphic design is ubiquitous; it is a major component of our complex print and electronic information systems. It permeates contemporary society, delivering information, product identification, entertainment, and persuasive messages. The relentless advance of technology has changed dramatically the way graphic designs are created and distributed to a mass audience. However, the fundamental role of the graphic designer-giving expressive form and clarity of content to communicative messages-remains the same.”4

<div id="tention">
5 - tENTION<br>
	Reviewing posters, books and basically everything connected to Graphic Design there is a few things which are important to create tension in order to catch and hold the viewers attention.
<br><br>
</div>


<div id="symmetry">
5.1 - sYMMETRY vS aSYMMETRY<br>
	Everything connected to design has a layout which needs to be balanced in order to make the design work in a harmonic way. The balance can be aligned symmetrical or asymmetrical.<br>
Symmetry, whether in text or image, is balanced through similarity. Everything is centered and can be seen as an exact mirror image on the vertical axis. It creates a passive space around the elements, meaning the space which is created though symmetry appears more like a background and doesn't really create any valuable attention – if noticed at all. It is just there, just indifferent.<br>
Asymmetry on the other hand attracts the viewers attention and creates guidance throughout the design. It is created in order to balance different elements of the design. It creates uneven white/empty space which, need to be applied wisely and are thought of. The space created is active. It creates dynamic and gives space for flexibility. As I mentioned before, evolving from human evolution, asymmetry does catch the viewers attention because of its imperfection.<br>
Even though Leonardo da Vinci's 'Vetruvian Man' suggests the ideal human proportions which should be symmetric many studies have proven wrong. The general public is not symmetric nor approves of a e.g. symmetric face to be perfect and finds the asymmetric and therefore more imperfect face more appealing.
<br><br>
</div>


<div id="space">
5.2 - sPACE iT uP<br>
	White space plays one of the most important roles during the process of designing. It is the very basis and what you start with when you first take a paper and pen or open a program. White space gives flexibility in arranging during the designing process. Nevertheless it needs to be used wisely in order to work well (e.g. make a heading or subject stand out). Moreover it should be seen as a shape to be treated carefully. Cluttering pages merely makes a good design to get a certain message across to the viewer and moreover confuses. The misuse of white space would only create a very noisy image. So using more white space and therewith emptiness creates more tension – but, as I said before, needs to be managed wisely.<br>
Just like when I wake up in the morning and have come to the realization that my coffee is empty. Or when you look at the Grand Canyon. Once there must have been water and massive amount of water gone through. Now it is nearly empty. We can only tell from the stones. I would say it is pretty imperfect situations. Thus it is a indicator of movement and activity. Something must have happened but nevertheless it is silent now. The absence of something always raises tension and creates awareness. As does white space on a page. White space should not look like it is waiting to be filled or create a feeling of missing elements, but rather be applied in the right amount. Luxurious designer brands have made great use of it. While the 1Dollar shop looks cluttered and stocked up to the ceiling a little boutique has more empty space around. Also their ads differ very much in the sense of white space usage. One could say the more white or empty space used, the more luxurious it it.<br>
All together for designers it is important to use the absence and its thereby created space and emptiness to create tension to catch and hold the viewers attention. The white space should be active.

5.3 - rIGHT rOUND, rIGHT rOUND<br>
		Ever tried to draw a perfect circle with a pen – you probably had to realize at some point that it is nearly impossible by hand. Only technology made it possible. But isn't that boring, plain. One perfect circle next to the other. The photographer Thomas Brown and the designer duo Lighning + Kinglyface teamed up and came up with a project to embrace the imperfection. The project is called 2-(y-b)2 = r2 which stands for the mathematical equation of a circle. By “using smoke, sugar, fabric and bubbles they make their point that the pursuit of perfection is a Sisyphean endeavor”1. An endless quest for perfection which is so absurd because it is the imperfections which give characteristics to the experiment and make it valuable.
<br><br>
</div>


<div id="hands">
5.4 - hANDS oN<br>
	Daily we are exposed to all kinds of visual stimuli and surroundings trying to push us into certain directions. From advertising promises to general public adapting to fashion and way of life. Technology is increasingly making our lives faster and faster. On the other hand then “it sounds paradox. But analog esthetics seem to gain enormous value as technology is proceeding. When first in the 80s technology was adopted without any compromise, in the 90s one turned more towards organic again. Nevertheless the quest and desire for the unpredictable never seems to have faded.”1<br><br>

Failure and usage as inspiration. As I mentioned before technology increases the speed of our lives and products don't have the time to really be used anymore before the next one already enters the market. Matthias Lange designed tableware to show in a poetic way how much value can be added when objects actually do show signs of use. He created tableware out of colored (CMYK) ceramic. The outside painted in white. So it seems perfect although i think quiet plain. Something you would have at home only using for special moments because you don't want the dishes to be in any way scratched or broken. You want them to be perfect. Because he used colored ceramic in the inside these dishes are different. Through actually breaking edges and making them imperfect the different colors become visible and the tableware gets more characteristics and becomes alive. Imperfection adding a huge amount of value to the dishes.<br>
Also other designers used the process as product for their inspiration and as part of their design. <br><br><br>

...conditional design.
The process is the product.

		Nowadays everybody has a computer and Do-It-Yourself blogs and gurus are spreading increasingly fast. More often it's getting complicated with clients as they want to have a say in the designing process because everybody understands themselves as a Designer.
