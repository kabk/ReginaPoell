		ABSTRACT.
			If we strive for perfection one must realize that perfection is firstly judged by the standpoint of the viewer, thus might be very different from one another, but 'by definition takes us beyond assumptions and what we think we know'1. The quest for perfection therefore is quiet impossible or a never successful story. If we come up with a concept and ideas, in order to succeed with the project, we automatically build up an image in our minds which we strive for.
		 Nevertheless there is a huge 'gap between the intention and realization of an artwork which makes failure impossible to avoid'2. Although many people fear imperfection it is exactly that little something which opens a new range for artists. As 'to be an artist is to fail like no other dare to fail'3. This leads to a certain point where an artist is actually allowed to fail. There is a point in each project where one has to let go in the sense of giving up control, releasing it to the public. In this case the artist then enters an area of not-knowing which can easily become an act of bravery. Who hasn't experiences the feeling of embarrassment, when you just want to shrink to a little nothing or disappear in the ground when judged by others. That act of bravery standing strong and keeping your head up means to step aside from the orthodox order. To succeed in failing or to fail at failing. And then again often it's worth considering that the deepest failures are in fact no failures at all'4.
